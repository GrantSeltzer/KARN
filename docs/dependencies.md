If you are using Karn as a library for enforcing seccomp you must have:

- libseccomp-dev [debian-like](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libseccomp) / [centos-like](https://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libseccomp-devel)

If you are using Karn to generate OCI compliant seccomp profiles to pass to containers, there are no external dependencies.
